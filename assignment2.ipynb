        "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about? **This paper is about data tidying, a process part of data cleaning that makes datasets easier to manipulate, model, and visualize.**\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish? **It provides a standard way to organize data values within a dataset (it makes initial data cleaning easier because you don’t need to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel every time).**\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" **The sentence means that out of the numerous ways to structure a dataset, there are common patterns that make datasets easier to use.** What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\" **Obervations and variables can easily be identified due to context (there is a given template/structure by the dataset). However, there is no universal definition for what is a variable or observation, as different datasets/problems require different structures. For observations, should an entity be a single observation or split into multiple parts. For variables, there are a wide range of possible types and meanings the respective variable can take in different contexts. Therefore, context gives meaning to observations and variables.**\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations? **A value is either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if qualitative) and belongs to a variable and observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes**\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3? **It is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure.**\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? **Column headers are values, not variable names. Multiple variables are stored in one column. Variables are stored in both rows and columns. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.** Why are the data in Table 4 messy? **The column headers are values (instead of variables) that should be instead stored as values in a column called income.** What is \"melting\" a dataset? **It is the same as stacking it - turning columns into rows.**\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"? **Table 11 is messy as it has variables stored in rows and columns - it has variables in individual columns (id, year, month), spread across columns (day, d1–d31) and across rows (tmin, tmax) (minimum and maximum temperature). Meanwhile, Table 12 is tidy as variables are stored as column headers and each column contains corresponding values (except for 12a that has the names of variables in the element column).**\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? **If tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be inextricably linked to tidy data. This makes it easy to get stuck in a local maxima where independently changing data structures or data tools will not improve workflow.** What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling? **He hopes that others will build on this framework of data tidying to develop even better data storage strategies and better tools.**"
