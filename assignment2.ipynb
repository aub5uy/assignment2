        "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about? **This paper is about data tidying, a process part of data cleaning that makes datasets easier to manipulate, model, and visualize.**\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish? **It provides a standard way to organize data values within a dataset (it makes initial data cleaning easier because you don’t need to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel every time).**\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" **The sentence means that out of the numerous ways to structure a dataset, there are common patterns that make datasets easier to use.** What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\" **Obervations and variables can easily be identified due to context (there is a given template/structure by the dataset). However, there is no universal definition for what is a variable or observation, as different datasets/problems require different structures. For observations, should an entity be a single observation or split into multiple parts. For variables, there are a wide range of possible types and meanings the respective variable can take in different contexts. Therefore, context gives meaning to observations and variables.**\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations? **A value is either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if qualitative) and belongs to a variable and observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes**\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3? **It is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure.**\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? **Column headers are values, not variable names. Multiple variables are stored in one column. Variables are stored in both rows and columns. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.** Why are the data in Table 4 messy? **The column headers are values (instead of variables) that should be instead stored as values in a column called income.** What is \"melting\" a dataset? **It is the same as stacking it - turning columns into rows.**\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"? **Table 11 is messy as it has variables stored in rows and columns - it has variables in individual columns (id, year, month), spread across columns (day, d1–d31) and across rows (tmin, tmax) (minimum and maximum temperature). Meanwhile, Table 12 is tidy as variables are stored as column headers and each column contains corresponding values (except for 12a that has the names of variables in the element column).**\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? **If tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be inextricably linked to tidy data. This makes it easy to get stuck in a local maxima where independently changing data structures or data tools will not improve workflow.** What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling? **He hopes that others will build on this framework of data tidying to develop even better data storage strategies and better tools.**"

        "1. Numeric variable: For `./data/airbnb_hw.csv`, clean the `Price` variable as well as you can, and explain the choices you make. How many missing values do you end up with? (Hint: What happens to the formatting when a price goes over 999 dollars, say from 675 to 1,112?) **When the price goes over $999, the formatting style adds a comma for the thousands place; hence, I changed this in the code below. Also, I converted the Price variable to type numeric (from string). There are 0 missing values in the Price column.**\n",
        "2. Categorical variable: For the `./data/sharks.csv` data covered in the lecture, clean the \"Type\" variable as well as you can, and explain the choices you make. **First, I sorted the data by type in Excel and combined the 4 categories boat, boating, boatomg, and watercraft into watercraft. We can also combine the unconfirmed, unverified, and under investigation categories into an unclear category. Also, we can consider removing columns with type invalid, as these were not shark-related cases (552 of these invalid cases were reported); however, I decided to keep the data for reference. There were 5 empty cells which I kept as is, as it represented unidentified cases.**\n",
        "3. Dummy variable: For the pretrial data covered in the lecture, clean the `WhetherDefendantWasReleasedPretrial` variable as well as you can, and, in particular, replace missing values with `np.nan`. **Here, 0 represented not release, 1 represented released, and 9 represented an unclear situation. Therefore, I replaced the values of 9 with np.nan - there were no empty cell values for the `WhetherDefendantWasReleasedPretrial` variable.**\n",
        "4. Missing values, not at random: For the pretrial data covered in the lecture, clean the `ImposedSentenceAllChargeInContactEvent` variable as well as you can, and explain the choices you make.

        "**Responses for Q5:**\n",
        "1. The U.S. Census collects data on race through individual self-reporting. In the 2020 Census, respondents were asked to select one or more races from a list of predefined categories, including options such as Black, White, Asian, Latino, Indigenous, and others. Respondents could select all categories that applied to them, allowing for multiple race selections.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Gathering data based on race helps with Demographic Analysis (data helps understand the racial composition of the population, a vital element to planning public services, resource allocation, and policy development), Civil Rights Enforcement (data is used to monitor and enforce civil rights laws, including the Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act), Social and Economic Research (data helps analyze disparities in areas such as education, employment, housing, and healthcare), and Political Representation (data is used to draw congressional districts, ensuring fair representation).\n",
        "Data quality matters because inaccurate/incomplete data may lead to misallocation of resources, misrepresentation in political processes, and ineffective policy decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The Census did well by allowing for multiple race selections, recognizing the complexity of individuals' racial identities. However, the predefined race categories may not cover all possible racial identities, potentially leading to underrepresentation or misclassification of some groups. Future surveys should have more comprehensive options - these options should be updated each census - and keep the other section for individuals to write in their own responses. Some of the good facets of the Census (including self-reporting, multiple response categories, accessiblity, and data quality checks) could be very useful in data collection for other areas to get more diverse and representative data from the respective population.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The U.S. Census collects has previously collected data on sex as a binary male/female. This is important to understand the gap in gender diversity. However, this section should change in the future to including a question about gender identity to better capture gender diversity.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Some concerns about cleaning data with protected characteristics are that the people/machines that clean the data have access to a person's protected characteristics like sex, gender, sexual identity, or race; these can potentially be sensitive topics for the individual and cause them harm if the data was leaked. If there are missing values, it can be hard to put a placeholder value, as this may not accuratly represent the individual. Hence, some good practices are to protect the privacy and confidentiality of respondents while trying to keep their data as original/true as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. One concern I would have regarding an algorithm that imputes values for protected characteristics is that if the algorithm is biased, it could severely impact the accuracy of the imputed values, especially for underrepresented groups (as there is not enough training data to output data representative of this smaller group). In response to this, I would want the algorithm's decision-making process to be very transparent so that we know exactly how it is imputing values. Another key concern is regarding privacy of the personal data, as this data would be fed as training data for the algorithm - consent would be required from the individuals."
